# DAIT - Diabetic Diet AI Assistant 

Imagine having a personalized assistant that not only understands your dietary needs but also actively supports your journey towards managing diabetes effectively. Introducing our innovative solution for diabetic patients: an AI-powered meal planning assistant.

With our platform, diabetic individuals can effortlessly navigate their daily meals while staying mindful of their blood sugar levels. Our assistant operates in two seamless modes to cater to different preferences and lifestyles. In 'cooking mode,' it connects users to nearby markets, suggesting ingredients tailored to their dietary requirements and preferences, making meal preparation a breeze. Alternatively, in 'pickup mode,' it collaborates with delivery apps, intelligently selecting meals based on their nutritional content, calorie counts, and personal profiles, ensuring every meal aligns with their health goals.
